Dear {NOMINATOR_NAME}:

Thank you for taking the time to submit the nomination of {NOMINEE_NAME} for the {AWARD_NAME}.

The three references you gave will be contacted by our office and asked for a letter of recommendation.   Once we have received their letters the selection committee will be evaluating the nominations over the next few weeks and in accordance with its charge will make a recommendation to the Chancellor during the spring semester.  If accepted, this recommendation will then go before the Board of Trustees at their March meeting.  The Chancellor will then notify the individuals chosen.

As is often the case, we have received many outstanding nominations this year. Appalachian has always been fortunate to have faculty and staff dedicated to serving our students.  Your time and effort in completing this nomination is greatly appreciated and it will be given the careful consideration it deserves.
